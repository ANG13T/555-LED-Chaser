# 555 LED Chaser
LED Chaser circuit based on the NE555 and the CD4017 created for a San Diego workshop sponsored by Hack Club!

### Circuit Explanation
This circuit creates a sequential flashing animation of 10 LEDs which is operated by the CD1017 and 555 integrated circuits. 
It requires a VCC and GND from a 9V battery and allows you to monitor the clock output with an auxiliary pin header.
The clock speed of the 555 can be altered using the trim potentiometer.

### 555 IC Overview 
The 555 IC is configured to be in astable mode. This causes the IC to behave like an oscillator switching its output between HIGH and LOW states to generate a square wave signal which can be fed into the CD4051 IC.
