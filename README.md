# 555 LED Chaser
LED Chaser circuit based on the NE555 and the CD4017 created for a San Diego workshop sponsored by Hack Club!

## Circuit Explanation
This circuit creates a sequential flashing animation of 10 LEDs which is operated by the CD1017 and 555 integrated circuits. 
It requires a VCC and GND from a 9V battery and allows you to monitor the clock output with an auxiliary pin header.
The clock speed of the 555 can be altered using the trim potentiometer.

## 555 IC Overview 

The 555 IC is configured to be in astable mode. This causes the IC to behave like an oscillator switching its output between HIGH and LOW states to generate a square wave signal which can be fed into the CD4017 IC.

The pinout characteristics of the 555 is as follows:

| Pin Number | Name         | Function                                            |

| 8          | VCC          | Supply Voltage: Typically +5V                        |

The internal mechanism of the 555 consists of two comparators 


## CD4017 Overview
Belonging to the CMOS 4000 series of logic chips, the CD4017 is a decade counter with 10 decoded outputs (labeled Q0 through Q9) used to light up our 10 LEDs!
It sequentially counts from 0 to 9 on its outputs for each clock pulse applied to its clock input (CLK) and then resets back to 0.
